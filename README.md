This is a library of JavaScript functions that take an iterable
and mimic the functionality of many Array methods.

The name comes from "star" for the asterisk wildcard character
(representing the many Array methods that are mimiced)
and "it" for iterable.

See star-it-spec.js for usage examples.
To run the tests, enter "npm test".
